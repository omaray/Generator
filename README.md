# Generator
This program gives an example of how to take as input a Service Name with a Resource Definition and then generate a full gRPC client and gRPC server that communicate with one another. There is also support for pushing the server code into a Docker container which can then be deployed locally and become the gRPC server. This simulates a client communicating with a remote server.
